- Hi, I’m Eray.
- After completing my high school education in Turkey, 
- I came to Toronto to learn computer programming and software development.
- Before I came to Toronto, my knowledge of computer programming was very limited.
- I am trying to improve my programming skills in order to create a strong portfolio.

- I’m currently learning C, C++ and C# languages. 
- I am also interested in game development.
- I started to learn Unity 3D.
- I decided to create a portfolio using gitHub.
